    <br>Jordan was born in New York but grew up in San Diego. After graduating from Torrey Pines High School, he studied music and physics at Oberlin College. He worked for two years, realized he did not have a passion for e-commerce, and decided to become a patent attorney. He is in his second year at UCLA School of Law. Jordan still loves to play the guitar and visits the beach as often as possible.

    <td width="400"><b>Jessie's story:</b>
    <p>I played in the Jazz Band every year during high school. After my sophomore year, the group had a lot of turnover, and Jordan joined as our resident guitarist. We were instant best friends, having similar passions, work ethics, and a certain humor about life. It wasn't until one of my female friends asked me if he was "available," did I realize how much I actually liked him. Carefully walking the friendship line, I asked him to be my date to the Winter Formal dance, and, of course, he said "yes."</p>

  <table cellpadding="20"><tr><td width="400"><b>Jordan's Story:</b>
<p>After graduating from Oberlin in 2010, I moved to Boston to be with Jessie while she finished her degree at Olin. When Jessie entered her senior year, I realized we had been together for nearly eight years, and I decided the time was right. During that fall, I planned the perfect proposal. We flew to San Diego for the winter holidays, and on December 23, ring secretly in hand, I suggested we watch the sunset from our favorite spot: the cliffs in Torrey Pines. Just after sunset, I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me, and, of course, she said “yes!”</p></td>
