    Jordan was born in New York but brought to San Diego at a young age, and so calls Southern California his home. After graduating from Torrey Pines High School, he studied music and physics at Oberlin College, earning a B.A. in Physics. After spending two years in the work force, Jordan decided to become a lawyer and has recently finished his first year at UCLA Law School. Jordan still loves to play his guitar and visit the beach as often as possible.
